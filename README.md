## ðŸ”· What Is Mocha Pro Plugin?
Mocha Pro is the advanced version of the Mocha planar tracking system developed by Boris FX. Itâ€™s available both as a plugin and as a standalone application, and it integrates with:
- Adobe After Effects / Premiere Pro
- Avid Media Composer
- OFX hosts like Nuke, DaVinci Resolve, Fusion, Vegas Pro, etc.
The plugin version allows you to launch Mocha Pro directly from within your video editing or compositing software.
## ðŸ”§ Core Features
1. Planar Tracking
- Tracks flat surfaces or patterns even when objects move out of view.
- More stable and precise than point tracking.
2. PowerMesh Tracking
- Tracks non-rigid surfaces like clothing, skin, and organic shapes.
3. Rotoscoping Tools
- Create masks and mattes with spline tools and edge feathering.
- Use Mochaâ€™s magnetic Object Brush and AI-assisted Matte Assist for faster masking.
4. Object Removal
- Remove unwanted elements like boom mics, wires, people, or logos.
- Automatically fills in background using tracked frames (like content-aware fill, but more reliable).
5. 3D Camera Solver
- Converts 2D tracking data into 3D camera movement.
- Export to After Effects, Nuke, Blender, etc.
6. Stabilization
- Smooth out shaky footage using planar data.
- Can lock or partially stabilize shots while preserving motion.
7. Lens Distortion Correction
- Calibrate and remove lens distortion.
- Useful for matching CG elements into live-action footage.
8. Insert Module
- Composite graphics or video into tracked planes.
- Great for screen replacement and match-moving.
9. Advanced Export Options
- Export data to multiple hosts: After Effects, Nuke, Fusion, HitFilm, Silhouette, etc.
- Export masks, corner pins, transforms, 3D cameras, and more.

## ðŸ§  AI-Powered Enhancements (Latest Versions)
- Object Brush (AI Masking): Quickly define a subject with a single stroke and track it over time.
- Matte Assist ML: AI propagation of a mask through the whole video with fine control.
- Face Detection: Auto-track and isolate multiple faces.
- Frame Interpolation: Smart removal or enhancement of broken frames or dropped footage.
